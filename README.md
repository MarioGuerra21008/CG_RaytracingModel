# Cube Nerd Face using Raytracing

In this project I create a replica of the emote ðŸ¤“ using cubes made with a struct Cube and Raytracing.

This raytracing includes the following aspects:

* Camera rotation, allowing to zoom in and zoom out the camera.

* 5 different materials, the "body" of the emote, the eyes and eyebrows, the glasses, the teeth and the freckles.

* A frightening skybox with Teletubbies, representing that these characters found the emote during the day.

Finally, we have this video showing all these aspects required in the project.
